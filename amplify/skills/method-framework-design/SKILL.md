# Method & Framework Design (Phase 3)

## Overview

This is the most critical branching point in the research workflow. Type M and Type D projects follow completely different design paths. Executing the wrong path — or skipping design entirely — guarantees wasted effort.

## On-Demand Literature Search (Active Throughout Phase 3)

<IRON-LAW>
Phase 1 literature review is the STARTING POINT, not the final word. During method/framework design, you WILL encounter questions that require additional literature:

- "Has anyone tried approach X for this problem?"
- "What's the current SOTA for sub-task Y?"
- "Is there theoretical justification for design choice Z?"
- "What hyperparameters did paper W use for this baseline?"

**When this happens: SEARCH IMMEDIATELY.** Do not guess, do not rely on memory, do not defer to "we'll check later." Use web search, arXiv, Google Scholar, or any available tools to find the answer NOW.

**Update the literature record:** Any new papers found during Phase 3 should be added to `docs/02_literature/paper-list.md` with a note: `[Found during Phase 3 — method design]`.

**If search fails** (no results, paywall, or tools unavailable): do NOT fabricate an answer. Instead:
1. Note the specific question that needs answering: "Need to know: [question]"
2. Record it in the exploration report
3. Ask the user: "I couldn't find information on [X]. Do you know, or can you check?"
4. Continue with what you know, marking the gap as an assumption to verify

This applies equally to Phase 4, 5, and 6. Literature retrieval is a continuous activity, not a one-time Phase 1 task.
</IRON-LAW>

## Re-Entry from Phase 4a (Exploratory Return Path)

If the user returns to Phase 3 from Phase 4a exploration (because baseline results or data analysis revealed the method/analysis design needs rethinking), do NOT start from scratch:

1. **Read the Phase 4a exploration report** (`docs/05_execution/phase4a-exploration-report.md`)
2. **Carry forward what was learned**:
   - Type M: baseline performance, actual failure patterns (may differ from predicted), error analysis
   - Type D: data characteristics, patterns found in EDA, what analyses are/aren't promising
3. **Targeted redesign**: Only redesign the parts that the exploration revealed as problematic. If the evaluation protocol is still valid, keep it. If the innovation point needs adjustment, adjust only that.
4. **Re-run the multi-agent design deliberation** (M-Step 5 or D-Step 4) with the new context — agents should have access to the Phase 4a exploration report
5. **Update G2 outputs** — the revised plan goes through G2 checklist again before re-entering Phase 4b

## Branching Logic

```dot
digraph branching {
    rankdir=TB;
    start [label="G1 passed\nresearch-anchor.yaml confirmed" shape=doublecircle];
    check [label="research_type?" shape=diamond];
    M [label="Type M Path\n(Method Development)" shape=box style=filled fillcolor="#d4edda"];
    D [label="Type D Path\n(Discovery / Data Analysis)" shape=box style=filled fillcolor="#cce5ff"];
    C [label="Type C Path\n(Tool / Software)" shape=box style=filled fillcolor="#e0d4ff"];
    H [label="Type H Path\nExecute BOTH tracks\nMark primary track" shape=box style=filled fillcolor="#fff3cd"];
    gate [label="G2 Gate\nPlan Freeze Checklist" shape=doubleoctagon style=filled fillcolor="#f8d7da"];

    start -> check;
    check -> M [label="M"];
    check -> D [label="D"];
    check -> C [label="C"];
    check -> H [label="H"];
    M -> gate;
    D -> gate;
    C -> gate;
    H -> gate;
}
```

Read `research_type` from `docs/01_intake/research-anchor.yaml`. If absent, STOP and invoke `domain-anchoring` first.

## Type M Path — Method Development

### M-Step 1: Lock Evaluation Protocol

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `amplify:evaluation-protocol-design` if available. If unavailable, follow the procedure below.

For each item, propose with justification, then get explicit user confirmation before proceeding:

1. **Primary metrics** — why these measure the core claim
2. **Evaluation protocol** — K-fold, train/val/test, episode-based, etc.
3. **Seeds** — recommend: `[42, 123, 456, 789, 1024]`
4. **Statistical reporting** — mean ± std, 95% CI, significance test
5. **Evaluation datasets** — rationale for each dataset choice

Write to `docs/03_plan/evaluation-protocol.yaml` using `templates/evaluation-protocol.yaml`. Set `locked: true` only after user confirms every item.

### M-Step 2: Design Innovation Method

Build on literature insights and cross-domain inspiration from Phase 1–2.

- **Innovation Point** (limit 1–2): state precisely what is novel
- **Value Proposition**: why this works — ground in theory or strong intuition
- **Predicted failure modes**: what could go wrong, and backup plan for each

Write `innovation_point` and `value_proposition` to `research-anchor.yaml`.

### M-Step 3: Confirm Baselines and Pre-Existing Results

**3a. Consolidate baseline list:**

1. Import `user_specified` baselines from Phase 1 (`docs/02_literature/baseline-collection.md`) → these are automatically `must_include`
2. System recommends additional baselines from literature review (target total: 3–5 for `must_include`)
3. Ask user again: *"Are there additional methods you want to compare against?"*
4. For each baseline, record:
   - Name and citation
   - Source: `official_repo` / `our_implementation` / `paper_reported`
   - Official code URL (if available)
   - Configuration notes (hyperparameters, training setup)

**3b. Check for pre-existing results:**

Ask: *"Do you already have results for any of these baselines? (e.g., from your own prior experiments, or from a standardized benchmark leaderboard)"*

If user provides pre-computed results, for each one verify:
- [ ] Which dataset(s) and split(s) were used?
- [ ] Which metrics were reported?
- [ ] How many seeds/runs? What were the seed values?
- [ ] What execution environment? (hardware, software versions)
- [ ] Source: `user_own_run` / `paper_reported` / `leaderboard`

Record in `evaluation-protocol.yaml` baselines section with a `pre_computed` field.

**Compatibility check** — once `evaluation-protocol.yaml` is drafted (M-Step 1), compare pre-computed results against the locked protocol:

| Check | Compatible | Action if incompatible |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| Same metric | ✅ | Use directly |
| Different metric | ❌ | Must re-run with correct metric |
| Same dataset + split | ✅ | Use directly |
| Different split | ❌ | Must re-run with correct split |
| ≥ 3 seeds | ✅ | Use directly (even if different seed values) |
| < 3 seeds or unknown | ⚠️ | Accept as reference but re-run for official comparison |
| Same execution regime (e.g., same epochs, same HP budget) | ✅ | Use directly |
| Different regime | ⚠️ | Use as reference; consider re-running for fairness |

Mark each pre-computed result as:
- `accepted` — fully compatible, no re-run needed
- `reference_only` — useful context but must re-run for official comparison
- `incompatible` — must re-run

Write to `evaluation-protocol.yaml` baselines section.

### M-Step 4: Pre-Design Ablation Experiments

For each key component of the proposed method:

| Component | Ablation Method | Expected Impact |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| *(fill)* | Remove / replace / simplify | *(predicted Δ on primary metric)* |

### M-Step 4b: Theoretical Analysis Plan (Optional but Recommended)

If the proposed method makes claims that can be theoretically grounded, plan the theory work here. This is OPTIONAL — not all method papers need theory. But if the target venue values theoretical justification, this significantly strengthens the paper.

**When to include theoretical analysis:**
- The method involves a new optimization objective → prove convergence
- The method involves a new algorithm → analyze time/space complexity
- The method makes approximation claims → prove bounds
- The method has correctness requirements → prove correctness
- The target venue is theory-friendly (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, SIAM)

**When NOT needed:**
- Pure empirical papers at applied venues (e.g., application workshops, domain-specific conferences)
- System/tool papers where the contribution is engineering, not algorithmic
- The method is a straightforward application of existing, already-proven components

**If included, plan:**

1. **What to prove**: List specific theorems/propositions (e.g., "Theorem 1: Algorithm converges at rate O(1/√T)")
2. **Proof strategy sketch**: What mathematical tools will you use? (e.g., Lyapunov analysis, VC theory, concentration inequalities)
3. **Required assumptions**: What conditions must hold? Are they realistic?
4. **Fallback**: If the proof doesn't work, what weaker result would still be valuable?

Record in `docs/03_plan/theoretical-analysis-plan.md`.

### M-Step 5: Multi-Agent Method Design Deliberation (AUTOMATED — MANDATORY)

<IRON-LAW>
For Type M, the method design determines whether the paper will be a genuine contribution or a trivial variation. A single agent designing a method has inherent blind spots — it may overestimate novelty, underestimate baselines, or miss simpler alternatives. Multi-agent deliberation catches these before months of implementation.

This is ESPECIALLY critical for Type M. Method development research lives or dies by whether the idea is both novel AND effective.
</IRON-LAW>

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Follow `amplify:multi-round-deliberation` protocol (max 5 rounds).

**Agent composition for Type M:**

| Agent | Role | What They Optimize For |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| **Innovation Advisor** | Creativity and novelty expert | Is this idea truly novel? Could it be more creative? What cross-domain inspiration is being missed? |
| **Technical Architect** | Implementation and scalability expert | Can this actually be built and trained? Are there engineering bottlenecks? Is the design clean? |
| **Baseline Devil's Advocate** | Competitor and ablation expert | Can a simpler method achieve the same result? Are baselines strong enough? What will reviewers compare against? |

**Dispatch — Round 1 (parallel):**

## Type D Path — Discovery / Data Analysis

Type D does NOT need alternative method comparison. Type D is results-driven, not method-driven.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `amplify:analysis-storyboard-design` before finalizing the Type D plan. If unavailable, follow the D-Step process below manually.

### D-Step 0: Data Choice Validation (BEFORE designing any analysis)

<IRON-LAW>
For Type D, the data IS the foundation. A poor data choice guarantees a weak paper regardless of how good the analysis is. Before designing the analysis framework, validate the data choice:

**Check 1 — Has this dataset been exhaustively analyzed?**
Search for papers and tutorials that have analyzed this exact dataset. If the dataset is a standard tutorial/benchmark dataset (e.g., PBMC 3k, Iris, MNIST), it has almost certainly been analyzed with the exact tools you plan to use.

**Check 2 — Can standard tools on this data yield NEW findings?**
If the answer is "probably not" (e.g., everyone already knows what cell types are in PBMC 3k), then either:
- Choose a different, less-studied dataset
- Apply a genuinely novel analytical angle
- Design a comparative study (multiple datasets, conditions, or timepoints)

**Check 3 — Does the data have enough complexity for discovery?**
A single-sample, well-characterized dataset (e.g., one healthy donor's blood) may not contain enough biological variation to support novel findings. Consider: multiple conditions? Disease vs. healthy? Time series? Multiple tissues?

If the data fails any check, present alternatives to the user:

```
The dataset [name] may not support novel discovery because:
[reason from checks above]

Alternatives that could yield stronger findings:
1. [Suggest a less-studied dataset in the same domain]
2. [Suggest adding a comparative dimension]
3. [Suggest a different analytical angle]

Which direction would you prefer?
```
</IRON-LAW>

### D-Step 1: Design Analysis Framework

Plan analysis dimensions in order:

1. Descriptive statistics & data characterization
2. Main analysis (hypothesis testing / modeling)
3. Mechanism exploration (why does the pattern exist?)
4. Robustness checks (sensitivity, subgroups, alternative specs)
5. Exploratory analysis (unexpected patterns)

Define the story structure:
- **1 main story line** + **2–4 supporting lines**
- For each line: what figures, what statistics, what conclusions

### D-Step 2: Define Sufficiency Criteria

IRON LAW: **ANALYSIS MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE. NO SHORTCUTS.**

Sufficiency checklist — every box must be checked before G2:

- [ ] Data explored from multiple angles?
- [ ] Main hypothesis tested from multiple perspectives?
- [ ] Exploratory analysis planned for unexpected patterns?
- [ ] All analyses connect back to story line?
- [ ] Statistical support sufficient for each claim?
- [ ] Confounders identified and addressed?
- [ ] At least 4–6 content points with planned figures/tables?

### D-Step 3: Pre-Identify Alternative Explanations

For each expected finding, list plausible alternative explanations that analyses must rule out.

| Expected Finding | Alternative Explanation | How to Rule Out |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| *(fill)* | *(fill)* | *(specific analysis or control)* |

### D-Step 4: Multi-Agent Analysis Design Deliberation (AUTOMATED — MANDATORY)

<IRON-LAW>
Even for Type D, the analysis framework must be vetted by multiple perspectives. A poorly designed analysis plan leads to shallow findings that reviewers will tear apart. The analysis must be SUFFICIENT in scope — it's better to plan slightly more analyses than needed and filter in Phase 5, than to discover gaps after execution.
</IRON-LAW>

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Follow `amplify:multi-round-deliberation` protocol (max 5 rounds).

**Agent composition for Type D:**

|-------|------|----------------------|
| **Domain Scientist** | Expert in the biological/scientific domain | Are we asking the right biological questions? Are the expected findings meaningful? |
| **Methodology Consultant** | Expert in analytical methods | Are the right tools/methods chosen? Are there better analytical approaches? |

## Type C Path — Tool / Software

Type C is utility-driven. The contribution is not algorithmic novelty (Type M) or scientific discovery (Type D), but a tool that solves a real problem better than existing alternatives — faster, more usable, more scalable, or covering an unmet need.

### C-Step 1: Define the Utility Claim

State precisely what the tool does better than alternatives:

- **Primary claim**: "[Tool] enables [task] that was previously [impossible / slow / manual / error-prone]"
- **Quantitative targets** (at least 2):
  - Speed: X× faster than [competitor] on [benchmark]
  - Scalability: handles [scale] that [competitor] cannot
  - Accuracy/quality: matches or exceeds [competitor] on [benchmark]
  - Usability: reduces [task] from N steps to M steps

### C-Step 2: Design Evaluation Framework

Tool papers need a DIFFERENT evaluation from method papers:

| Evaluation Dimension | What to Measure | How |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Correctness** | Does it produce correct results? | Compare output vs reference / gold standard |
| **Performance** | How fast? Memory? | Benchmark suite (standardized if available) |
| **Scalability** | How does it scale with input size? | Scaling curves (1×, 10×, 100× input) |
| **Comparison** | How does it compare to existing tools? | Head-to-head on same benchmarks |
| **Usability** (optional) | How easy to use? | API design review, installation test, example workflows |
| **Case studies** | Does it work on real problems? | 2-3 real-world use cases from the domain |

Record in `docs/03_plan/evaluation-protocol.yaml` (adapted for tool evaluation).

### C-Step 3: Identify Competing Tools

List ALL existing tools that address the same or similar problem:

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

This becomes the comparison table in the paper.

### C-Step 4: Multi-Agent Tool Design Deliberation (AUTOMATED — MANDATORY)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Follow `amplify:multi-round-deliberation` protocol (max 5 rounds).

**Agent composition for Type C:**

| Agent | Role | What They Optimize For |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| **Target User** | Domain practitioner who would use the tool | Does this solve my actual workflow? Is the API intuitive? What's missing? |
| **Competing Tool Expert** | Expert on existing tools in this space | How does this compare? What advantages do competitors have that we're ignoring? |
| **Software Quality Advisor** | Software engineering and architecture expert | Is the codebase maintainable? Documentation sufficient? Installation easy? Edge cases handled? |

All three agents get: tool description, API design, evaluation plan, competing tools list.

Each agent evaluates: utility, completeness, comparison fairness, documentation quality.

**Present deliberation results to user, then proceed to G2.**

### C-Step 5: Confirm Story Line

Present the narrative arc for user approval:

> **Problem (user pain)** → **Why existing tools fail** → **Our tool's approach** → **Benchmark results** → **Real-world case studies**

## Type H Path — Hybrid

Execute **both** Type M and Type D tracks. Before starting, ask user: *"Which track is primary — the method contribution or the discovery contribution?"* Mark the answer in `research-anchor.yaml` under `primary_track`.

For Type H, treat ALL of these as mandatory:
- `amplify:evaluation-protocol-design`
- `amplify:analysis-storyboard-design`
- **M-Step 5 (Method Design Deliberation)** for the method component
- **D-Step 4 (Analysis Design Deliberation)** for the discovery component

The two deliberations can run sequentially (primary track first) or, if independent, in parallel.

## G2 Gate Checklist — Plan Freeze

ALL applicable items must be satisfied. Present this checklist to the user for sign-off.

**Type M items:**
- [ ] `evaluation-protocol.yaml` locked
- [ ] Innovation method fully argued, `innovation_point` marked
- [ ] Baselines confirmed with sources
- [ ] Ablation plan documented
- [ ] Failure modes predicted with backup plans for each

**Type D items:**
- [ ] Analysis framework and storyboard frozen
- [ ] Sufficiency criteria defined and all boxes checked
- [ ] Alternative explanations pre-identified

**Type C items:**
- [ ] Utility claim stated with quantitative targets
- [ ] Evaluation framework defined (correctness, performance, scalability, comparison)
- [ ] Competing tools identified and compared
- [ ] Case studies planned
- [ ] Documentation plan in place

**Universal items:**
- [ ] Story line confirmed by user
- [ ] `value_proposition` written in `research-anchor.yaml`
- [ ] Venue target still reasonable (invoke `venue-alignment` check)
- [ ] User approved everything explicitly

Only after ALL applicable items pass: set G2 status to `passed` and proceed to execution phase.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Let me just try something first" | Undirected experiments waste compute and produce uninterpretable results. Design first. |
| "The evaluation can be decided later" | Post-hoc evaluation selection is cherry-picking. Lock metrics NOW. |
| "This is too simple to need a full design" | Simple methods still need locked evaluation, baselines, and a story line. Simplicity ≠ no planning. |
| "I already know what will work" | Then it should be trivial to write down. If you can't write it, you don't know it. |
| "Baselines are obvious" | Obvious to you ≠ convincing to reviewers. Document and confirm. |
| "Analysis doesn't need a framework" | Unstructured analysis produces shallow, incomplete results every time. |

## Red Flags — STOP Immediately

- Writing implementation code before G2 passes
- Choosing metrics without user discussion
- Skipping baselines "because the method is different"
- Starting Type D analysis without sufficiency criteria
- Merging Type H tracks without marking a primary
- Proceeding without explicit user approval on story line

## Checklist

1. Read `research_type` from `research-anchor.yaml`
2. Branch to correct path (M / D / H)
3. Complete all steps for the applicable path
4. Present G2 gate checklist to user
5. Get explicit user approval on every item
6. Mark G2 as passed — proceed to `experiment-execution`

<IRON-LAW>
## ⛔ MANDATORY STOP — After G2 Gate

After presenting the G2 gate checklist, **END YOUR RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY.**

Do NOT invoke `experiment-execution` in this same response.
Do NOT begin implementing code, downloading data, or setting up experiments.
Do NOT proceed to G3 check.

**STOP. WAIT. The user must approve the frozen plan before any execution begins.**

Your final output should be the G2 checklist followed by:
"G2 gate checklist is above. Plan is frozen. Do you approve proceeding to Phase 4 (Experiment Execution)?"

Then STOP.
